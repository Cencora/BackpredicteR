<h5>Back-PredicteR is an application which helps you to back-predict signals (response) to concentrations (results) when the relation between the response and the result is known. 
A typical example is when you want to determine the concentration of unknown samples by performing an assay in a laboratory.
For that, you have first to determine the relation between the response of your assay (absorbance, fluorescence,â€¦) and the concentration of your sample (result) by measuring the response of your assay for samples of known concentration (calibration data) and establishing the calibration curve.
You can then back-predict the concentration of unknown samples using their response and the calibration curve.</h5>
